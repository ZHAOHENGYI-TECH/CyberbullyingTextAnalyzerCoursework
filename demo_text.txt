
This is a sample text for demonstrating the cyberbullying text analyzer.
Some people write stupid comments that are really annoying.
I hate when people say dumb things like "shut up" or use bad language.
But most of the time, people are just trying to be helpful.

The analyzer can detect different levels of toxic language:
- Mild toxicity: words like silly, boring, dumb
- Moderate toxicity: words like stupid, annoying, hate  
- Severe toxicity: words like crap, hell, and offensive phrases

This demonstration shows how the system categorizes and scores text content.
